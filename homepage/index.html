				<p>Searching for MoreUnit for IntelliJ and friends? <a href="https://github.com/MoreUnit/org.moreunit.intellij.plugin">Here it is!</a></p>
				<p>MoreUnit is an Eclipse plugin (licensed under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/EPL-1.0">EPL</a>) that should assist you in writing more unit tests, mainly targeted at the Java language. This is a short
				overview of the features it provides, for further information take a look at the documentation section.</p>
				<p>MoreUnit offers menus and shortcuts to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="featured">jump to test</span>(ed) files/methods corresponding to the element your are editing (<em>Ctrl-J</em> by default). If none exists, it proposes you to create it.<em class="lang all"></em></li>
					<li><span class="featured">run test</span> classes/methods from the class under test (<em>Ctrl-R</em> by default).<em class="lang java"></em><em class="lang groovy"></em></li>
					<li><span class="featured">generate</span> a test method stub for the method under your cursor.<em class="lang java"></em><em class="lang groovy"></em></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Moreover:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>MoreUnit <span class="featured">decorates files</span> which have a test case.<em class="lang all"></em></li>
					<li>In the editor, it <span class="featured">marks methods</span> which are under test.<em class="lang java"></em><em class="lang groovy"></em></li>
					<li>Rename classes/methods and MoreUnit will <span class="featured">rename</span> the corresponding test code too.<em class="lang java"></em><em class="lang groovy"></em></li>
					<li>Move classes and MoreUnit will <span class="featured">move</span> the corresponding test cases.<em class="lang java"></em><em class="lang groovy"></em></li>
					<li>With the Mock plugin: select the dependencies of a class that you want to <span class="featured">mock with your favorite library</span>, and MoreUnit will generate the boiler-plate code in your test class.<em class="lang java"></em></li>
				</ul>

				<h1>MoreUnit Install</h1>
				<h2>Which version should I install?</h2>
				<p>If you code in Java or Groovy, you definitely should install <em>MoreUnit For Java</em>, as it brings many code edition and
				refactoring features. Otherwise <em>MoreUnit Light</em> will still help you a lot!</p>
				<h2>Option A: Use Eclipse Marketplace</h2>
				<p>If you have Eclipse Marketplace installed, open it from Eclipse's Help menu. Then search for MoreUnit, and click on the &quot;Install&quot;
				button displayed on the result. It will add MoreUnit update site to your settings and install the plugin altogether.</p>
				<h2>Option B: Add MoreUnit's update site manually</h2>
				<p>Go to <em>Help &gt; Install New Software...</em>. Click on <em>Add...</em>, then enter the following URL and validate:</p>
				<pre>http://moreunit.sourceforge.net/update-site/</pre>
				<p>You can now select the plugin(s) you want to install from MoreUnit update site and proceed.</p>
				<h2>Option C: Download the archive</h2>
				<p>Download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/moreunit/files/latest/download" target="blank">latest archive</a>.
				After that open <em>Help &gt; Install New Software</em>. On the upcoming dialog click on the <em>Add</em>-Button. In the
				<em>Add repository</em> screen choose your downloaded archive.</p>
				<p>(If this link doesn't work, please go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/moreunit">http://sourceforge.net/projects/moreunit</a>.)</p>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-coregeneral">
				<h1>General information</h1>
				<p>With version 3.0.X we have added basic support for all languages. That means you can configure basic settings which
				get applied to all languages (described in the next section) and you can specifiy settings for any specific language
				which is applied only to that language. Last but not least these settings can be done global (in the preferences) or
				on a project base (properties). The UI looks the same for both.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-coresettings">
				<h1>Preferences/properties for all languages</h1>
				<p>In the preferences/properties navigate to MoreUnit &gt; User Languages and the following UI will show up:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/coresettings.png" width="850" height="659" alt="Core Settings" /></figure>
				<h2>Rule for locating test files</h2>
				<p>The <em>source path</em> is the place where your project sources are saved. A simple example is that if you save
				your sources in a folder called <tt>src</tt> within your project then the source path should look like:
				<tt>${srcProject}/src</tt>.</p>
				<p>The configuration for corresponding test path is similar. E.g. if your save your tests in a folder called
				<tt>tests</tt>, the property should be set to <tt>${srcProject}/tests</tt>.</p>
				<h2>Rule for naming test files</h2>
				<p>In this section you can specify how you name your tests. E.g. if you suffix your tests with <em>Test</em>, the pattern
				should look like <tt>${srcFile}Test</tt>.
				A more complex example for a common pattern is <tt>${srcFile}*(Test/DbTest)</tt>. That means your tests can be suffixed
				with <em>Test</em> or <em>DbTest</em>, and the star is a wildcard. (Examples for valid test names for
				<em>MyFile.java</em> are: <em>MyFileSimpleTest.java</em>, <em>MyFileComplexDbTest.java</em>).</p>
				<p>If you use a word separator like _ (e.g. foo_bar) this can be configured here as well to help MoreUnit finding your
				tests. If you use camel case (e.g. FirstSecondThirdWord) nothing needs to be configured here.</p>
				<p>To get some help with the configuration take a look at the demonstration area where you can test your pattern.
				If you click on the link <em>Test</em>, examples of your pattern will show up in the yellow fields.</p>
				<h2>Per language configurations...</h2>
				<p>If you work with different languages it could be necessary to configure settings for each language.</p>
				<p>To create a new preference page enter a language name (e.g. Ruby) which will be used to label the new preference page,
				and a file extension (e.g. rb). If you click the <em>Create Configuration</em> button, a new preference page will show up on
				the left, ready to be configured.</p>
				<p>To delete a language specific configuration you created, take a look at the preference page for this language. There
				is a button labelled <em>Delete Configuration</em> at the beginning of the preference page:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/deletecoresetting.png" width="561" height="453" alt="Delete core setting" /></figure>
				<p>To configure settings for Java or Groovy, you should not use the basic version of MoreUnit. We offer a <em>MoreUnit for Java</em>
				plugin with great features which are far beyond the basic support.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-javafirstconf">
				<h1>First configuration</h1>
				<h2>Step 1: Install MoreUnit</h2>
				<p>Please refer to the <a href="#doc-install">dedicated section</a>.</p>

				<h2>Step 2: Activate Decoration of classes</h2>
				<p>Choose <em>Eclipse|Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; General &gt; Appearance &gt; Label Decorations</em> and activate <em>Decorate Classes with
				Test Case</em>.</p> 

				<h2>Step 3: Enter your preferences</h2>
				<h3>a) General preferences</h3>
				<p>Before you can start you have to configure some preferences.</p>
				<p>If the source folder for your preferences is not named &quot;<em>test</em>&quot; you have to enter the name of your test source folder (for instance:
				<em>src/test/java</em>).</p>
				<p>By default MoreUnit expects your test cases to be named with the suffix &quot;Test&quot;. For example if a class is named
				<em>HelloWorld</em> then the test case should be named <em>HelloWorldTest</em>. If your naming convention differs from this default you have to
				enter your naming rule here. Note that you can enter several prefixes and suffixes, via a simple regex-like expression.</p>
				<p>In some projects package prefixes/suffixes are used (e.g. tests of classes in package <em>com.foo.*</em> are saved at <em>test.com.foo.* /
				com.foo.test.*</em>), which can be configured as well.</p> 
	
				<h3>b) Project specific	preferences (optional)</h3>
				<p>If you have sourced out tests to another project you will have to define project specific settings. Select the project and open <em>Properties
				&gt; MoreUnit &gt; Java</em>. Then choose the project which contains the tests for the underlying project.</p>
				<p>If you have other settings that differ depending on the projects in your workspace you can define them under the tab <em>Other</em>.</p>
	
				<h2>Step 4: Start coding</h2>
				<p>Configuration is over, you may now start coding :-) Switch between your production code and your tests with the shortcut <em>Ctrl-J</em>, and run your
				tests from both place with <em>Ctrl-R</em>.</p>
				
				<div class="js-additional-doc-nav hidden"><p>You can also read the <a href="#">other documention pages</a>.</p></div>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-groovysupport">
				<h1>Groovy support</h1>
				<p>All features of MoreUnit for Java will work with Groovy too! Even the test case creation wizard will be a groovy one.
				Unfortunately, we never took the time to extract it as full plugin with its own properties, so be aware that your Java
				settings will be used!</p>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-labeldecoration">
				<h1>Label decoration</h1>
				
				<p>Class decoration is implemented in a very simple way. Based on the settings (test case prefixes and suffixes) MoreUnit tries to find a matching
				class in the underlying project. If for instance "Test" is an element of your test case suffix list (this is the default setting on first
				installation) Foo will be marked with a small green icon in the package explorer if a class named FooTest exists in the underlying project.</p>
				<figure><img src="img/classDecoration.png" width="252" height="257" alt="A class having tests is decorated" /></figure>
				
				<p>Decoration is disabled by default. You have to enable label decoration via <em>Eclipse|Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; General &gt; Appearance
				&gt; Label Decorations &gt; Decorate Classes with Test Case</em>.</p>
				<figure><img src="img/classDecoPref.png" width="451" height="322" alt="Decoration preferences" /></figure>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-editormarker">
				<h1>Marker in the editor</h1>
				
				<p>You can configure MoreUnit to mark methods having test methods with a green marker in the vertical
				ruler of the editor.</p>
        <img src="img/marker-pref.png" width=651" height="60" alt="MoreUnit annotations' preferences">
				<img src="img/markerEditor.png" width="348" height="272" alt="Markers in Java editor">
				
				<p>If you want MoreUnit markers to appear in the overview ruler or if you want to disable markers in the editor this can be done via the annotation
				preferences of Eclipse (to highlight ignored tests there is a yellow marker which can be configured separately):</p>
				<img src="img/annotations.png" width="756" height="563" alt="Annotation preferences">
			</section>
			<section id="doc-classtestswitching">
				<h1>Switching between test and class under test</h1>
	
				<p>You can jump from java classes which are open in the editor to the corresponding test cases via the contextual menu of the editor or via the
				shortcut <em>Ctrl-J</em>. MoreUnit identifies the name of the class under the cursor. To find the corresponding test case the prefixes and suffixes
				from the preferences are used. If exactly one test case is found the file gets opened. If more than one test case is found a dialog is shown and
				prompts you to choose which test case you want to work on (alternatively a new test case can be created from the dialog):</p>
				<figure><img src="img/dialog.png" width="151" height="103" alt="Test selection wizard" /></figure>
	
				<p>If no test case is found the test case wizard is shown, initialized with the settings from the preference page:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/wizard.png" width="546" height="660" alt="Test creation wizard" /></figure>
	
				<p>MoreUnit also tries to identify the test method(s) corresponding to the method under the cursor and directly jumps to it if only one is found.
				<br />Example: For a method named "addTree" tests named "testAddTree" or "testAddTreeSUFFIX" will be detected as test method.</p>
	
				<p>Also, if you activated the extended method search, a test method that calls your method will be found, whatever its name. <br />Finally, please
				note that jumping also works the other way, to go back to your production code.</p>
	
				<p>The shortcuts for the jump/generate action are configurable. If you want to change the default keys go to <em>Window &gt; Preferences... &gt;
				General &gt; Keys</em> and change the settings of the commands named "Create Test Method" and "Jump to Test".</p>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-testcreation">
				<h1>Test case/test method creation</h1>
				<p>To generate a test-method stub choose "Generate Test Method" from the pop-up menu within an editor. MoreUnit identifies the method under the cursor and
				generates a test method stub. At first MoreUnit tries to find a test case for the underlying resource (if you want to know how this is done, take a
				look above at "Jump to test"). If no test case is found the test case wizard is shown. If the method under the cursor is named "amethodname" the
				generated test method will be name "testAmethodname", assuming you defined "test" as a prefix in MoreUnit preferences. If MoreUnit detects a test
				method with this name no method stub is generated.</p>
				<div class="imagelist">
					<img src="img/creationFrom.png" width="225" height="134" alt="A production method..." />
					<img src="img/creationTo.png" width="239" height="161" alt="... and the test created for it" />
				</div>
	
				<p>MoreUnit doesn't jump to the test method automatically so you have to jump to the test case if you want to edit it.<br>
				The shortcuts for the jump/generate action are configurable. If you want to change the default keys go to <em>Eclipse|Window &gt; Preferences... &gt;
				General &gt; Keys</em> and change the settings of the commands named "Create Test Method" and "Jump to Test".</p>
				<p>If you use the "Generate Test Method" action on a test method MoreUnit creates a second test method.</p>
				<img src="img/secondTest.png" width="309" height="236" alt="Another test method" />
			</section>
			<section id="doc-testlaunching">
				<h1>Running a test from class under test</h1>
	
				<p>If you have a class under test you can run the corresponding test case class(es) directly from this class by hitting <em>Ctrl-R</em>.</p>
	
				<figure><img src="img/runningFromCut.png" width="783" height="593" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Note: if you have several TestNG test classes for a given class and you are using a version of the TestNG plugin that is older than
				version 5.14.2.10, MoreUnit will ask you which test class to launch. In that case please consider upgrading TestNG to version 5.14.2.10+.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-missingtestmethodsview">
				<h1>Missing test method view</h1>
				<p>MoreUnit offers a view to show the methods of the classes you are working on which do not have a test method yet. To use this view just open it:
				<em>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other... &gt; Missing Test Methods</em>.<p>
				<figure><img src="img/view.png" width="252" height="92" border="0" alt="" /></figure>

			<section id="doc-refactoringsupport">
				<h1>Refactoring support</h1>
	
				<p>MoreUnit offers some refactoring support:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you rename a class and a corresponding test case exists, MoreUnit will rename it too.</li>
					<li>There is a similar behavior for methods: if you rename a method having one or more corresponding test methods, then all those methods are
					renamed accordingly (see screenshots below).</li>
					<li>Finally, MoreUnit also support "move" refactorings: if you move a class to a different package MoreUnit will move the corresponding tests
					as well.</li>

				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="doc-workspacepreferences">
				<h1>Preferences</h1>
	
				<p>To use MoreUnit you can/should configure the preference page to fit your personal needs. All these settings can be configured for the whole
				workspace or for each project.</p>
	
				<figure><img src="img/preferences_page.png" width="706" height="541" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Directory for test cases: The folder containing your tests.</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_dir.png" width="484" height="28" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>In the following screenshot tests are stored in the <em>junit</em> folder:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_dirExample.png" width="226" height="193" alt="" /></figure>
				
				<p>If you store your tests in a different project you will have to use the <a href="#doc-projectproperties">specific settings</a> of your
				main project to reference the test project:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_project.png" width="344" height="231" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Use test-prefix for test-methods: Whether test methods are prefixed with <em>test</em>. Automatically checked when using JUnit3:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_method_prefix.png" width="285" height="21" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Test method content: The default content of test methods generated by MoreUnit:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_method_content.png" width="479" height="23" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Test file naming pattern: Specify this pattern to reflect your naming convention (by default, <em>Test</em> is defined as a suffix):</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_pattern.png" width="462" height="93" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Package suffixes/prefixes: If you are using prefixes or suffixes for your test packages. For example: If tests for classes in the package
				<em>com.foo.*</em> are stored under <em>com.foo.test.*</em> you have to enter &quot;test&quot; into the package suffix property.</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_package.png" width="408" height="55" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>You can configure a super class which is used in the <em>New Test Case</em> wizard. If you use JUnit3, org.junit.TestCase will be automatically
				used as a super class, whether you defined it here or not.</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_superclass.png" width="478" height="26" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Example: Class: Foo.java Tests: FooTest.java, FooSituation1Test.java, FooSituation2Test.java Assuming you have specified &quot;${srcFile}*Test&quot; as a
				test class naming pattern, when using the action 
				<em>Jump to Test</em> from Foo.java, MoreUnit shows a lightweight pop-up menu to let you choose the test class you want to jump to.</p>
				<figure><img src="img/jumpDialog.png" width="172" height="117" alt="" /></figure>
	
				<p>Enable extended search for test methods: If you name your test methods with more meaningful names than just the name of a method that is being
				tested, you should activate this option:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/pref_extended_search.png" width="251" height="22" alt="" /></figure>
				
				<p>In the following example, MoreUnit will find that <em>nothingIsComputedIfNoEntryIsGiven()</em> is a test method for <em>Service.compute()</em>:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/extended_search_example.png" width="362" height="110" alt="" /></figure>

			<section id="doc-projectproperties">
				<h1>Project specific settings</h1>
	
				<p>Project specific settings allow to configure mappings between source folder(s) and test folder(s) (e.g. if you have several test folders). In
				the following you can see some examples of projects and the corresponding mappings for MoreUnit.</p>
	
				<p>In the first example tests are saved in a different test project. The specific settings to configure are those of the project that is being
				tested, i.e. containing the production code <em>org.moreunit.plugin</em> below:</p>

					<figure><img src="img/properties/Config2.png" width="391" height="297" alt="" /></figure>
				</div>
	
				<p>In the third example the project has two separate test folders <em>test1</em> and <em>test2</em> which are both mapped to the same source folder
				<em>src</em>:</p>

			<section id="doc-extensionpoint">
				<h1>Extension points</h1>
				
				<h2>addTestmethodParticipator</h2>
				<p>You can add an extension point to be called after test method creation in MoreUnit. The extension point gets the test method context, that can
				be used to replace or modify the created test method.</p>
				
				<p>The following is a small snippet to declare the extension point in a plugin.xml:</p>
				<pre>
	&lt;extension point="org.moreunit.addTestmethodParticipator"&gt;
		&lt;client class="simplelistener.MyAddTestMethodParticipator"/&gt;
	&lt;/extension&gt;
				</pre>
				
				<p>And here is a short snippet to replace the created method:</p>
				<pre>
	public class MyAddTestMethodParticipator implements IAddTestMethodParticipator
	
		@Override
		public void addTestMethod(IAddTestMethodContext context) {
			// Get test method from context
			IMethod testMethod = context.getTestMethod();
			try {
				// Delete old test method
				testMethod.delete(true, null);
				// Create a new one
				IMethod createMethod = context.getTestClass().findPrimaryType()
						.createMethod("void hello() {}", null, true, null);
				// Update context
				context.setTestMethod(createMethod);
			} catch (JavaModelException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();

				that you want to be mocked in the new page that appears in the "New Test Case" wizard:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/mock-usage-example-wizard-page.png" width="552" height="417" alt="'New Test Case' wizard: 'Dependencies To Mock' page"
				/></figure>
				
				<p>This feature is also available for already existing test cases: just right click in the Java editor when viewing either the class under test or
				the test case and choose <em>MoreUnit &gt; Mock Dependencies in Test Case...</em><p>
				<figure><img src="img/mock-usage-example-menu-action.png" width="642" height="142" alt="Menu action: Mock Dependencies" /></figure>
	
				<p>As an example, the previous wizard opened for the following code:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/mock-usage-example-input.png" width="822" height="519" alt="A class with dependencies" /></figure>
				
				<p>... on validation it will produce the following code if you use Mockito:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/mock-usage-example-result-mockito.png" width="568" height="355" alt="Dependencies mocked with Mockito" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>... or the following one if you use EasyMock:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/mock-usage-example-result-easymock.png" width="658" height="274" alt="Dependencies mocked with EasyMock" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>JMock and JMockit are also supported, as well as PowerMock in combination with Mockito and EasyMock. You can choose your preferred mocking
				framework and result style in the preferences or your workspace or project:</p>
				<figure><img src="img/mock-usage-example-preferences.png" width="664" height="447" alt="Mocking preferences" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>We also aim to provide the following features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>default values for types that are not mockable: primitive types, their corresponding wrappers, etc...</li>
					<li>support for other mocking frameworks or output styles if you ask for it (see <a href="#about">our contact page</a>)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Finally, you can create your own templates to support your custom configurations.</p>
				<p>All you have to do is to place them in your workspace, under <em>.metadata/.plugins/org.moreunit.mock/templates</em>,
				and then to load them via the "Reload templates" button in MoreUnit preferences (<em>Preferences &gt; MoreUnit &gt; Java &gt; Mock Generation</em>).
				Your templates will also be taken into account at restart.</p>
				<p>Fore more information and to validate your templates, please refer to the <a href="http://moreunit.sourceforge.net/schemas/mocking-templates.xsd">XSD</a>.
				You might also learn from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/moreunit/code/ci/master/tree/org.moreunit.mock/resources/templates/">existing templates</a>.</p>

				<p><em>Note: this feature &mdash; the templates &mdash; has been primarily developed to ease the pain of working with legacy code bases. Within a
				fresh project, we advise you to adopt a test-first approach ;-)</em></p>

				<h2>My project has more than one test source folder (e.g. unit &amp; functional)?</h2>
				<p>You have to use project specific settings. There you can configure more than one test source folder (this can not be done with the workspace
				settings of MoreUnit).</p>
				
				<h2>I'm getting error messages after installing the plugin.</h2>
				<p>Current versions of MoreUnit do not support Eclipse versions older than 3.4. If you can not switch to a recent version of Eclipse try to
				install older versions of MoreUnit.</p>

				</ul>
				
				<h2>2006-06-15: Version 0.5.2</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>MoreUnit is published under the Eclipse Public License from now on.</li>
					<li>The two projects MoreUnit and SwitchUnit are merged.</li>
					<li>JUnit4 support is implemented (configurable at the MoreUnit-preference page).</li>
					<li>To create a new test case the Eclipse test case wizard is used (initialized with MoreUnit-specific preferences).</li>
					<li>Minor Bugfixes and smaller enhancements.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>2006-05-01: Version 0.4.3</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>MoreUnit offers refactoring support now. Renaming a class or a method leads to a dialog to rename corresponding test cases or methods
					either.</li>
					<li>Suffix for test case (usually Test) can be configured via the preferences.</li>
					<li>Older versions of MoreUnit only offered the possibility to jump via a shortcut to the corresponding test case or test method. Since
					version 0.4.3 it is possible to switch between test case/test method and class/method under test with the same shortcut. (Thanks to
					Jiming Liu, who asked for this feature).</li>
					<li>Java template preferences (comments) are used for new test cases.</li>
					<li>Switched MoreUnit java 1.5</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>2006-03-23: Version 0.3.2</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>New marker icon (if you had already installed a version of MoreUnit you have to start Eclipse once without MoreUnit and afterwards you
					can install the newest version, don't know what the problem is, but if you don't go this way, no new marker icon will appear) for tested
					methods and MoreUnit got extended to recognize test-methods.</li>
					<li>Marker icons are now persistent and will be restored automatically after workbench restart.</li>
					<li>Moved actions to add / delete marker from the workspace to the project pop-up menu in the package explorer.</li>
					<li>I tried to implement a refactoring support for corresponding tests (rename of class should rename corresponding tests) but had problem
					with the current API. So if I want to see this feature in this plugin, please vote for this bug at eclipse.org:
					<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=132746">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=132746</a></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>2006-01-23: Version 0.3.1</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>"Jump to test" jumps to the corresponding test method, if possible.</li>
					<li>Marker position always beside method signature (they where positioned beside a comment if there was one above the signature in earlier
					versions).</li>
					<li>In earlier releases test cases had been created in a wrong project sometimes (under special circumstances), this problem should be
					fixed now.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>2006-01-08: Version 0.3.0</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The plugin works now with Eclipse 3.1.1 (and draws the markers for tested methods)</li>
					<li>Folder for the tests can now be configured via the preferences panel</li>
					<li>Minor bugfixes</li>
				</ul>
