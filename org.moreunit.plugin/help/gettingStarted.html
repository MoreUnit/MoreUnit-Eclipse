    <body>
		<h1>Activate Decoration of classes</h1>
		<p>Choose WINDOW &rarr; PREFERENCES &rarr; GENERAL &rarr; APPEARANCE
		&rarr; LABEL DECORATIONS and activate "Tested Class Indicator (MoreUnit)".</p>

		<h1>Enter your preferences</h1>
		<p>Before you can start you have to configure some preferences.</p>
		<p>If the source folder for your preferences is not named "junit"
		you have to enter the name of your test source folder.</p>
		<p>By default MoreUnit expects your test cases to be named with the
		suffix "Test". For example if a class is named HelloWorld then the test
		case should be named HelloWorldTest. If your suffix differs from this
		default you have to enter your choice here. Note that you can enter
		several suffixes. You can define prefixes for your test cases as well.</p>
		<p>In some projects package prefixes/suffixes are used (e.g. tests
		of classes in package com.foo.* are saved at
		test.com.foo.*/com.foo.test.*), which can be configured as well.</p>

		<h1>Enter your project specific preferences (optional)</h1>
		<p>If you have sourced out tests to another project you will have to
		define project specific settings. Select the project and open PROPERTIES
		&rarr; MOREUNIT. Then choose the project which contains the tests for
		the underlying project.</p>
		<p>If you have other settings that differ depending on the projects
		in your workspace you can define them under PROPERTIES &rarr; MOREUNIT
		&rarr; OTHER.</p>

		<h1>Start coding</h1>
		<p>Configuration is finished. Start coding :) Switch between
		class/test case or method/test method with the shortcut "Ctrl" + "J".</p>
